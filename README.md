# Project Overview
This project explores and visualizes arrest data from Phoenix, Arizona, using Python for data cleaning and Tableau for dashboard creation. The goal is to identify arrest trends across different precincts, time periods, and categories to help city officials or researchers better implement public safety policies.

The data was obtained from City of Phoenix Open Data at: https://www.phoenixopendata.com/dataset/arrests

Key Features:
- A map of Precinct-level Arrest Counts
- A donut chart of Criminal Charge percentages
- A bar chart of Arrestee Demographics
- A bar chart of Criminal Charge Counts
- Interactive filters for Year and Day of the Week

Insights:
- Maryvale/Estrella Precinct consistently has more people arrested than other precincts.
- Arrests spiked for in the Cactus Park, Desert Horizon, and Mountain View Precincts, but decreased afterwards, which may be signs of the city taking preventative measures.
- Misdemeanors and felonies are the most common criminal charges in the city.

Recommendation:
- The city should investigate Maryvale/Estrella Precinct, which consistently has the largest number of arrests in the city. 
- Is the policing in that precinct heavier than other precincts leading to more frequent arrests? Or is crime rate in that precinct higher than other precincts in the city?
