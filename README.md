# Phoenix Crime Dashboard
For this project, I did some data cleaning before using Tableau to make a dashboard for Crime in Phoenix, Arizona and publishing it to Tableau Public.

Check out the dashboard here: https://public.tableau.com/shared/6QPY5HZZ4?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

The Dashboard includes:
- A map of Precinct-level Arrest Counts
- A donut chart of Criminal Charge percentages
- A bar chart of Arrestee Demographics
- A bar chart of Criminal Charge Counts
- Interactive filters for Year and Day of the Week
